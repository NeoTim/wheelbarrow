  A broker initializer is in charge of getting information such as package name
  and analysis output directory. It also performs some other initialization
  functions (e.g., log configuration). Subclasses should implement method
  InitializeBroker(), which should return a "context" object. The context should
  have at least a package_descriptor attribute, which should contain a
  wheelbarrow_pb2.Package for the application under test.
